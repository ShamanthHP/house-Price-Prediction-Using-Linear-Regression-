# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a Machine Learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as average income, house age, number of rooms, and population in a given city. The dataset used for this project contains 5000 entries and includes the following features:

- **Avg. Area Income**: The average income of households in the city where the house is located.
- **Avg. Area House Age**: The average age of houses in the city.
- **Avg. Area Number of Rooms**: The average number of rooms for houses in the city.
- **Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms**: The average number of bedrooms for houses in the city.
- **Area Population**: The population of the city.
- **Price**: The price at which the house was sold.
- **Address**: The address of the house.

## Problem Statement

A real estate agent seeks assistance in predicting house prices for different regions in the USA. The goal is to create a Linear Regression model that can estimate the selling price of a house based on the provided dataset.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing, handling any missing values or inconsistencies.
   - Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and correlations.

2. **Model Development**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure the model's reliability.
   - Develop a Linear Regression model using the training data.
   - Fine-tune the model parameters to improve accuracy.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
   - Compare the predicted prices with the actual prices to assess the model's accuracy.

4. **Predictions**
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data points.
   - Provide real estate agents with estimates of what houses would sell for based on different features.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **IDE**: PyCharm
